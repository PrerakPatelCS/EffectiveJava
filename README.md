# EffectiveJava
Testing out things I learn in Effective Java.
The book heavily contains ideas from Design Patterns by the Gang of Four and the JLS 
(Java Language Specification)

This is a great book to read as it goes over the best practices for writing clean code
in Java, which is an Object-Oriented Programming Language.

I am taking notes from item to item, the book is not meant to be read sequentially,
so you will see jumps from items to items. I am also taking notes in a Google Doc
I am using this GitHub for making coding examples and practicing the implementations
